# Offscreen Indicator Manager
Developed for 2D games in the Godot Game Engine (https://github.com/godotengine/godot)

A small scene and accompanying script for Godot that handles automatically setting offscreen indicators for enemies; at-screen-edge sprites that point toward the direction of the enemy relative to the player and allow for the player to know where enemies are, even when they cannot see the enemy. The script includes simple object pooling for performance, can support any resolution, and is adjustable for the developer's need (including being reinterpreted as a minimap or radar).
